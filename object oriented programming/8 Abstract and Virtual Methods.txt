The keyword abstract indicates that a method has a virtual dispatch

An abstract method that has a definition in the same class is equivalent to a virtual method in other .NET languages

A class that has at least one abstract method without a definition is an abstract class
Instead, the name of the method is followed by a colon (:) and a type signature for the method

You can also give abstract methods default definitions by adding the definition to the class using the default keyword

Regardless of whether a base class implements its abstract methods, derived classes can provide implementations of abstract methods

To implement an abstract method in a derived class use override keyword
To implement an abstract method in the same class as the original abstract declaration use default keyword
