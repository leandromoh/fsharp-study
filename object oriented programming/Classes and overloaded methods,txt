Classes and overloaded methods
Second, in F#, overloaded functions arenâ€™t allowed. You can create (or reference from C#
libraries) classes that contain methods that are overloaded, but functions declared using
the let syntax can't be overloaded. For this reason, type inference doesn't completely
function on classes and methods.
