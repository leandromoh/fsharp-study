// The label for a union case does not have to have to have any type after it. The following are all valid union types:

type Result = 
  | Success                // no string needed for success state
  | ErrorMessage of string // error message needed 

// If all the cases are empty, then we have an 'enum style' union:

type Size = Small | Medium | Large
type Answer = Yes | No | Maybe
